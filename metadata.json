        "Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array",
        "of data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship",
        "creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects.",
        "With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify conus marine snails at species",
        "level [1] in collaboration with the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/). The taxonomy",
        "of these snails has changed significantly several times during recent years and the introduction of Deep Learning",
        "techniques allowing to classify them is a very valuable tool for the experts.\n",

        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for conus identification using",
        "images. The architecture used is an Xception [2] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow.\n",

        "The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with ",
        "the top 5 predictions.\n",

        "The training dataset has been provided by the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/) and",
        "it consists on a dataset containing images of 68 species of conus covering three different regions: the Panamic",
        "region; the South African region; and the Western Atlantic and Mediterranean region.\n",
